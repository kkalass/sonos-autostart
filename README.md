Sonos Autostart
===============
This project aims to provide a small service that automatically starts a certain radio station when it detects that a sonos has come up.

I deploy this tool on a RaspberryPi. It relies heavily on the great https://github.com/jishi/node-sonos-http-api .

Note: this is not even pre-alpha :-)
